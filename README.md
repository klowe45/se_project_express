# What To Wear (WTWR)

## What to Wear Back-End (Overview)

In this repo you will find the start of the back-end of "What To Wear" and further developing it's functionality.

##Functionality

se_project_express, uses some of the most common techniques to organize API's and how they are routed. In WTWR, you'll see that all routes are contianed in their own directory depending on what section it handles. Each section requires another directory (models) which contians the outline needed to organize the data from each request and reponse. WTWR uses MongoDB to store information.

##What to come

WTWR is clearly far from being completed. Further API updates. SignIn and security for data safety.
